# Valhalla Skin Server

This is an alternative skin server for Minecraft. It has a few benefits over
 the default Yggdrasil server from Mojang.

 - HD textures
 - Arbitrary metadata.
 - Non-skin uploads (Elytras and capes)

In order to take advantage of this server, [a client mod](https://github.com/MineLittlePony/MineLittlePony) is required.
 A standalone client mod may come in the future.

See the [wiki](./wiki) for details on endpoints.
